# LandShares
### ERC20 Smart contract for Quantum Impact/ UN susdev goals hackathon

#### What is it?
Smart Contract driven project to reduce abuse of farmers by landowners.
Supported by UN, SCs ensure that farmers, at zero risk, can contract to lease land for a period of growing, so that once the (trusted, international) retailer agrees that the product was delivered, payment is transferred in LandShares token (later will migrate to QI) direct from retailer to both landowner and farmer according to pre-agreed (or pre-defined) split.

To remove potential for duress, once a landowner makes a deposit and the three-way agreement is accepted by a farmer, then the farmer cannot release funds until the delivery date of the produce.

#### Current splits:
Retailers put no deposit down and cannot remove offers once placed on blockchain.
Landowners must place deposit on offers made by retailers, specifying exactly which land is to be leased to farmer. Landowners can back out and recieve deposit only if no farmer has accepted.
Farmers put no money down and lock landowner's deposit once they agree to an agreement. After completion date, farmer can release landowner's deposit.
If retailer pays, then landowner and farmer split money and landowner receives deposit.

#### Future development:
* The UN has this week launched QI coin. As the smart contract requires transactions to be made in an Ethereum token, using QI coin will be preferable to a token created solely for this application, as it will have a broader base of accessibility, reducing currency risk ansd supply risk.
* Admin panel - to be used, eg by UN, with rights such as setting the deposit amount for landowners / retailers using impartial macro knowledge. This is currently set by retailer.
